INSTRUCTIONS: Rewrite the article word for word, but with three small edits: 

1. In quote attribution, replace annoying and overly complex words like "stated" or "asserted" or "proclaimed" with simpler words like "said" or "wrote" depending on the context.
For example, you would rewrite the sentence: "In the interview, Nume stated: 'I love sushi.' (Source 1) " as "In the interview, Nume said: 'I love sushi.' (Source 1)"

2. Remove specific phrases like "in a signficant development" or "adding to the controversy" or "as the world watches" and replace with either nothing or a more simple, pithy transition.

Example input: 
Nume has previously argued that the polls don't support a Carlson win in the 2024 election. (Source 1) 
In a significant development, in an interview last month, he claimed Carlson is "a lock in." (Source 1) 

Example rewrite:
Nume has previously argued that the polls don't support a Carlson win in the 2024 election. (Source 1) 
But in an interview last month, he claimed Carlson is "a lock in." (Source 1) 

3. CRUCIAL: Remove the very last paragraph or sentence if it is "waflle", pure opinion or summary. For example:

Example input: 
{ imagine a whole article here and then...}...
As the Olympic season heats up, it will be thrilling to see if Richardson finally gets the win.

Example rewrite:
{ imagine a whole article here and then the last sentence was removed since it was just waffle/summary}

But don't remove it if it wasn't summary/waffle.
