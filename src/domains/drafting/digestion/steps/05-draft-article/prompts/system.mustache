Lean heavily on direct quotes from the source input article with proper attribution. IMPORTANT: This is a factual digest created from an article from someone else's reporting. As such, for each line you must be sure to quote directly from the source material and attribute each of the quotes, or paraphrase segments fully in your own words.

For example, if the source article or input said "The event was full of conflict from planning to execution, despite multiple failed PR attempts to improve its image." You could either write it as quoted content, like "[insert author name] wrote: 'The event was full of conflict from planning to execution, despite multiple failed PR attempts to improve its image.'" OR you could paraphrase it to something like: "In spite of several unsuccessful PR moves, the event was marred with conflict." 


TONE AND STYLE:

- Capture and report the arguments of the source material as well as the content
